Before I begin, it's worth noting that my svm model was not finished training at the time of writing this document. The code is complete but I was not able to obtain results in time.

The optimal parameters for the remaining models are listed in the table below. 
\begin{table}[]
\begin{tabular}{lll}
Algorithm & Parameter       & Optimal Value \\
logit     & penalty         & 1e-10         \\
tree      & cost complexity & .001          \\
tree      & tree depth      & 15            \\
tree      & min n           & 10            \\
nnet      & penalty         & 1e+00         \\
nnet      & hidden units    & 1             \\
knn       & neighbors       & 30           
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The out-of-sample performances were similar across each algorithm. The tree model scored the highest with a mean accuracy of .86 and knn scored the lowest with a mean of .84.
