I chose to use the rvest package in R to scrape data from Wikipedia. This data included every Heisman trophy winner in the history of the award. I would primarily be interested in how the positions and draft positions of the winners changed over time. I used my personal experience with rvest to scrape the data.

I chose to use the collegefootballdata.com API via the R package cfbfastR to pull data on every NFL draft pick since 2000. I did some analysis to roughly measure how much draft capital was allocated to each position group by year. I found some intuitive trends, such as the rise of the quarterback position and the steep decrease in draft capital allocated to fullbacks. I used the tidyverse and cfbfastR packages for this analysis. Note: I believe this package requires an API key which may affect code functionality when run on other machines besides my own.
